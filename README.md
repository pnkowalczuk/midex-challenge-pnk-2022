# Coding Challenge
## Notes from applicant

Hello! I'm not sure who will be reviewing my submission, but thank you for taking the time. Just a few things I'd like to tell you:


* I made my gradle wrapper with gradle 7.1.1 instead of 7.3.3. I did start with 7.3.3, but found 7.1.1 to be more stable.
* I did not add unit tests. I know that would have been good attention to detail, but I was told not to spend more than 4-6 hours, so I tried to stay within allotted time
* there is a infinite loop problem in `ReportingStructureServiceImpl.java`. Theoretically it should be impossible, as no one should be reporting to the people to whom their subordinates are reporting. Nonetheless it is programatically possible. If I were more worried about it I probably would have started with a hashset instead of converting to one at the end. I've written a bit more about this as comments in the file.
* Compensations have the potential for duplicate IDs. Two compensations for the same employee ID could result in duplicate IDs. If I were more worried about this I would likely ask the product owner to clarify or renegotiate the requirements. I also might have asked another dev some of the specifics of the mongoDB and gone from there.







## What's Provided
A simple [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) web application has been created and bootstrapped 
with data. The application contains information about all employees at a company. On application start-up, an in-memory 
Mongo database is bootstrapped with a serialized snapshot of the database. While the application runs, the data may be
accessed and mutated in the database without impacting the snapshot.

### How to Run
The application may be executed by running `gradlew bootRun`.

### How to Use
The following endpoints are available to use:
```
* CREATE
    * HTTP Method: POST 
    * URL: localhost:8080/employee
    * PAYLOAD: Employee
    * RESPONSE: Employee
* READ
    * HTTP Method: GET 
    * URL: localhost:8080/employee/{id}
    * RESPONSE: Employee
* UPDATE
    * HTTP Method: PUT 
    * URL: localhost:8080/employee/{id}
    * PAYLOAD: Employee
    * RESPONSE: Employee
```
The Employee has a JSON schema of:
```json
{
  "type":"Employee",
  "properties": {
    "employeeId": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "lastName": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "position": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "department": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "directReports": {
      "type": "array",
      "items" : "string"
    }
  }
}
```
For all endpoints that require an "id" in the URL, this is the "employeeId" field.

## What to Implement
Clone or download the repository, do not fork it.

### Task 1
Create a new type, ReportingStructure, that has two properties: employee and numberOfReports.

For the field "numberOfReports", this should equal the total number of reports under a given employee. The number of 
reports is determined to be the number of directReports for an employee and all of their distinct reports. For example, 
given the following employee structure:
```
                    John Lennon
                /               \
         Paul McCartney         Ringo Starr
                               /        \
                          Pete Best     George Harrison
```
The numberOfReports for employee John Lennon (employeeId: 16a596ae-edd3-4847-99fe-c4518e82c86f) would be equal to 4. 

This new type should have a new REST endpoint created for it. This new endpoint should accept an employeeId and return 
the fully filled out ReportingStructure for the specified employeeId. The values should be computed on the fly and will 
not be persisted.

### Task 2
Create a new type, Compensation. A Compensation has the following fields: employee, salary, and effectiveDate. Create 
two new Compensation REST endpoints. One to create and one to read by employeeId. These should persist and query the 
Compensation from the persistence layer.
